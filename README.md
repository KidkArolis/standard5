# standard5

JavaScript [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) Style, but for es5 browser environments.

Specifically, the differences from the original `standard` project are:

- es6 flag is false (so no es6 syntax)
- jsx flag is false
- node flag is false (but cjs modules are still supported)
- browser flag is true
